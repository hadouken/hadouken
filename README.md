# Overview

:information_source: Hadouken is out of date in many ways and is currently not being worked on at all.

I recommend trying to switch to Porla (https://github.com/porla/porla) which can solve some interesting problems in easy ways. Otherwise, there are alternatives that may be more attractive.

## Getting started

To get started, head over to [the releases](https://github.com/hadouken/hadouken/releases)
and download a binary for your platform. If none exists, you might need to
[build one yourself](http://docs.hdkn.net/en/latest/#building-hadouken).

Once Hadouken is installed, access the web interface by heading to
[http://localhost:7070/gui/index.html](http://localhost:7070/gui/index.html).

Please refer to [the documentation](http://docs.hdkn.net) for more information
on how to configure and run Hadouken on your platform.
