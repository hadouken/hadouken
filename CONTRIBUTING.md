# Contribution guidelines

You want to contribute to Hadouken? That is great. Please read through these docs first.

## Code

 * Make sure your code builds on both Windows and Linux. The `develop` branch is continuously built on Windows and Ubuntu.
 * Keep to standard C++11.
 * Keep to existing code style, i.e braces on new lines, space between statement and brackes (`if (condition)`). If in doubt, trust Visual Studio.

## Pull requests

 * Do your work in feature branches based on `develop`. `develop` is the main development branch in Hadouken and is where all code is pushed before making a release.
 * Pull requests should be tagged with [WIP] in the title if not finished already. This can also be done to provide discussion of a planned pull request before starting work.
 * Include as much detail as possible in the description, such as if the pull request solves a reported issue or implements a specific feature.
